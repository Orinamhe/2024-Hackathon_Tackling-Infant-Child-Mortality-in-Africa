**Objective**

To analyze the current state of child and infant mortality in Africa, identify the major contributing factors, and propose data-driven solutions data-driven strategies and interventions that policymakers, healthcare providers, and organizations can adopt to improve health outcomes for children.

**Summary and Recommendations**

South-East Asia showing dramatic reduction in infant and child mortality over the years, an important regional case-study. African countries like Seychelles, Mauritius and Cape Verde, with low mortality rates should also serve as a benchmark.

Low maternal mortality rates and presence of skilled health staff during birth are important factors that reduced child and infant mortality rates. Provision of health insurance and adequate vaccination will also reduce these mortality rates. Lastly, country-income status influences infant & child mortality.

The leading causes of mortality in infants and children under five years are premature birth, birth trauma and asphyxia, acute lower respiratory infections and malaria.
Nations should strive to improve the attendance of skilled health care staff during childbirth, as this will also lead to a decline in maternal mortality. Neo-natal and post-natal guidance is also essential. Health care worker trainings should also be implemented to improve the number of skilled staff.
High vaccination coverage is important in reducing child mortality rates, especially acute lower respiratory infections.
Subsidized insecticide-treated bed nets should be provided for malaria control, the second leading cause of child mortality.
Improving the income status of the country, which will correspond with the availability of better health infrastructure cannot be over-emphasized.
